A repository where I put some of the exercises from contest platforms I do 


# BattleDev exercises

* Link to the exercises (FR): https://www.isograd.com/FR/solutionconcours.php

* I created a template folder for my exercise folders. These allow me to locally program with the help of unit tests, and then copy paste the content of the production code to the pad of the website.
